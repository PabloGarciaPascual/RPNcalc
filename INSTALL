RNPcalc -- building and installing
==================================

Needs: Fortran 95/2003 (for gfortran version >= 4.6)
       GtkFortran, including gtk_hl

Step 0:
     Get RPNcalc from https://github.com/jtappin/RPNcalc

Step 1:
     Edit the Makefile. The lines you may need to edit are commented.

Step 2:
     make
     This will build the application.
     Possible problems:
     1) Can't find the gtk-fortran pkg-config file.
      a) pkg-config does not look in /usr/local, solution:
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig
b) GtkFortran is not installed, solution:
Get GtkFortran from https://github.com/jerryd/gtk-fortran/
      and build & install it, using the cmake build instructions.
     2) gfortran has an internal error, solution:
      Make sure you have gfortran 4.6 or better.

Step 3:
     sudo make install
     This will install the executable and desktop file. Alternatively
     if you just want to try it out, run:
     ./rpncalc
     in the rpncalc directory.
