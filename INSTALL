RNPcalc -- building and installing
==================================

Needs: Fortran 95/2003 (for gfortran: Version >= 4.6)
       GtkFortran, including gtk_hl (Gtk2 or Gtk3 version)
       latex2man, man and pdflatex to build the documentation.
       cmake for the preferred build system

Step 0:
     Get RPNcalc from https://github.com/jtappin/RPNcalc, this applies
     to both systems.

Using cmake (Preferred)
=======================

Step 1:
     Create a build directory in the toplevel rpncalc directory, we
     will call it "build" here, and cd to  it. DO NOT try to build in
     place (i.e. from the top-level directory) it will not work as
     files will be copied to themselves.

Step 2:
     cmake ..
     This will check that all needed software is present and create the
     needed Makefiles.
     To select between GTK2 and GTK3 use:
     cmake -DGTK=2 ..
     or
     cmake -DGTK=3 ..
     (The default behaviour is to check GTK2 first then GTK3).
     Possible problems:
     1) Can't find the gtk-fortran pkg-config file.
      a) pkg-config does not look in /usr/local, solution:
      	 export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig
      b) GtkFortran is not installed, solution:
      	 Get GtkFortran from https://github.com/jerryd/gtk-fortran/
      	 and build & install it, using the cmake build instructions.
     2) Can't find latex2man, solution:
     	Install latex2man. (In Ubuntu, it is in texlive-extra-utils, in
     	Arch it is in texlive-core).
     3) Can't find pdflatex, solution:
     	Install pdflatex. (In Ubuntu, it is in texlive-latex-base, in
     	Arch it is in texlive-bin).

Step 3:
     make
     This will build the binary and generate the documentation.
     Possible problems:
     1) gfortran has an internal error, solution:
      Make sure you have gfortran 4.6 or better.

Step 4:
     sudo make install
     This will install the binary, documentation and desktop file.


Old Hand Configured Method (Deprecated)
=======================================

Step 1:
     Edit the top-level Makefile. The lines you may need to edit are commented.

Step 2:
     make
     This will build the application.
     Possible problems:
     1) Can't find the gtk-fortran pkg-config file.
      a) pkg-config does not look in /usr/local, solution:
      	 export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig
      b) GtkFortran is not installed, solution:
      	 Get GtkFortran from https://github.com/jerryd/gtk-fortran/
      	 and build & install it, using the cmake build instructions.
     2) gfortran has an internal error, solution:
      Make sure you have gfortran 4.6 or better.
     3) Can't find latex2man, solution:
      Install latex2man. (In Ubuntu, it is in texlive-extra-utils, in
     	Arch it is in texlive-core).
     4) Can't find pdflatex, solution:
     	Install pdflatex. (In Ubuntu, it is in texlive-latex-base, in
     	Arch it is in texlive-bin).

Step 3:
     sudo make install
     This will install the executable and desktop file. Alternatively
     if you just want to try it out, run:
     ./src/rpncalc
     in the rpncalc directory.

Notes for using g95
-------------------

The alternative Fortran comiler g95, can be used to build RPNcalc but
there are a couple of edits necessary as it does not support inverse
hyperbolic functions or the execute_command_line subroutine (all of
which are Fortran 2008 features).

Inverse Hyperbolics:
	Uncomment the defintions at the end of utils.f90

execute_command_line:
	Comment out the execute_command line call at line 1313
	(24/12/2012 version) and the line on each side of it, i.e.:
!    if (vstatus == 0) then
!       call execute_command_line(trim(pdfviewer)//' '//pdffile, wait=.false.)
!    else

	and also the closing end if at line 1355. The PDF help viewer
	will not be available.

The program can then be build by using:

make FC=g95
