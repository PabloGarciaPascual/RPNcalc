       The gtk-fortran RPN calculator is a fully functional scientific  calcu‐
       lator  emulator. It is not based on any particular model of calculator,
       but rather assembles those features that I find useful in a calculator.
       It uses the stack-based reverse Polish logic system for 2 reasons:

       1.     That's  what  I  like  to use, and most calculator emulators are
              algebraic notation.

       2.     I'm lazy and it's a lot easier to  implement  a  reverse  Polish
              system.

       It  is  intended  to be both a useful tool, and a demonstration of what
       can be done using  gtk-fortran  (and  in  particular  the  fortran-only
       high-level  routines).  The  calculator  is entirely written in Fortran
       2003 (with a few 2008 features such as the execute_command_line subrou‐
       tine.

   EENNTTEERRIINNGG VVAALLUUEESS::
       All  values with RPNcalc are stored as double-precision reals (Gtk+ has
       no support for long doubles).

       Values can be entered either using the keypad, or by  typing  into  the
       entry box. Values entered from the keypad make sanity checks for 2 dec‐
       imal points or a decimal entered after the exponent  has  been  started
       and  the  change-sign  key  works in a reasonably intelligent way. When
       values are typed or pasted into the entry box, characters  that  cannot
       be part of a number are rejected with a warning.

       A  value may be transferred from the entry to the stack by pressing the
       keyboard Enter key while focus is on the entry window, or  by  clicking
       the  EEnntteerr  key  on the keypad. The DDuupp key copies the entry box to the
       stack without clearing the entry box. If the contents of the entry  box
       are not a valid number (i.e. a Fortran READ statement cannot convert it
       to a floating point value) a message is displayed in the status bar and
       you may edit the entry box to correct the problem.

   OOPPEERRAATTOORRSS::
       The operators (++, --, **, // and yy****xx and also the aattaann22 function) operate
       on the entry box and the top element on the stack if there is  anything
       in  the  entry box. If the entry box is empty, then they operate on the
       top 2 elements of the stack.

       Operators may also be accessed by typing the operator  into  the  entry
       window (N.B. The exponentiation operator is ^ rather than ** for conve‐
       nience of implementation). The addition and subtraction operators  will
       only  work  in this way if a sign would not be a valid part of a number
       where they are entered, notably + or - in an empty  entry  box  is  not
       treated  as  an  operator.  Note  also  that  operators at the end of a
       multi-character paste are not accepted.

       The result is placed on the top of the  stack,  and  displayed  in  the
       result window.

   FFUUNNCCTTIIOONNSS::
       The  functions operate on a single value, which is taken from the entry
       box if that has content or from the top of  the  stack  otherwise.  The
       result  is  placed on the top of the stack, and displayed in the result
       window.

       If the IInnvveerrssee checkbox is set, then functions are  replaced  by  their
       inverses  (e.g.  ssiinn  becomes  aassiinn),  in  addition,  the yy****xx operator
       becomes the corresponding root and the _r_o_l_l _d_o_w_n  button  becomes  _r_o_l_l
       _u_p.  Note that:

       1.     The  less-used  functions  in  the  pulldown are not affected by
              this, as none have meaningful inverses.

       2.     The power operator ^^ entered from the keyboard is not  converted
              to a root.

       The RRaadd, DDeegg and GGrraadd radio buttons are used to select Radians, Degrees
       or Grads for the trigonometric functions.

       The HHMMSS and the various base-_n keys  are  not  proper  functions,  they
       don't remove or add anything to the stack.  HHMMSSdisplays the contents of
       the entry box or the top of the stack as if it were a number  of  hours
       converted to _H_H::_M_M::_S_S_._s_s_s format (or _Ddd _H_Hhh _M_Mmm _S_S_._s_s_sss if the value is
       greater than 24). The HHeexxaaddeecciimmaall, Octal and BBiinnaarryy keys  will  display
       the  integer  representation  of entry value or the top of the stack in
       the respective notations provided that the value is an integer.

       Some less-used functions are in the MMoorree pulldown. The  aattaann22  function
       computes arctan(y/x) removing the quadrant ambiguities.

       Functions  whose  arguments are out of range will produce an error mes‐
       sage and the stack is left unchanged.

   SSTTAACCKK OOPPEERRAATTIIOONNSS
       **      CCEE clears the entry box, or if that is  empty  deletes  the  top
              entry on the stack.

       **      CCAA clears the entry box and all entries on the stack.

       **      The _u_p button moves the selected item in the stack up one place.
              If the top item (or nothing) is selected then  it  is  exchanged
              with the entry box.

       **      The  _d_o_w_n  button moves the selected entry on the stack down one
              place.

       **      The _r_o_l_l _d_o_w_n button, moves the last element of the stack to the
              top and all others down one place.

   CCOONNSSTTAANNTTSS::
       There  are  a number of built in fundamental physics constants that are
       build in to  the  calculator,  these  can  be  entered  from  the  PPhhyyss
       pull-down menu.

   MMEEMMOORRYY RREEGGIISSTTEERRSS::
       The  calculator  also  has memory registers (numbered from 0). The con‐
       tents of these registers can be viewed by selecting  the  ``registers''
       tab.  The  default  number of registers is 10, but this may be set with
       the --mm option, or by setting a new number in the spin box at the bottom
       of the registers tab.

       These can be accessed in one of two ways:

       1.     Select  a register in the registers tab, and then click a memory
              operation. In this case the value used will be the entry box  or
              the top of the stack if the entry is empty.

       2.     Enter  a  register  number in the entry box and click the memory
              operation. The value used is the top of the stack.

       The operations are:

       **      SSTTOO:: Store the value in the selected register.

       **      RRCCLL:: Copy the selected register to the top of the stack

       **      MM++:: Add the value to the selected register

       **      MM--:: Subtract the value from the selected register

       **      MMCCLL:: Clear the selected register.

       **      MMCCAA:: Clear all registers

   SSTTAATTIISSTTIICCSS::
       If the LLiivvee ssttaattss toggle is enabled, then a summary of the  statistical
       properties  of  the contents of the stack is maintained in the "Statis‐
       tics" tab of the display area.

   SSAAVVEE && RREESSTTOORREE::
       The stack, registers and entry box can be saved to and restored from  a
       text file with the FFiillee-->>SSaavvee and FFiillee-->>RReessttoorree menu items.

       The  file  format  is  a plain text file with the floating point values
       written in hexadecimal -- this allows the retention  of  full-precision
       but  is endian-independent. Obviously any machines that do not use IEEE
       floating point values will  not  be  able  to  read  files  from  other
       machines. Also any machine with a c_double that is not 8-bytes will not
       work.

   SSEETTTTIINNGGSS::
       In the current version, there are 2  user-definable  settings  accessed
       through the EEddiitt menu:

   RReessuulltt FFoorrmmaatt::
       Specify  the  format  to use in the result box. You have the options to
       select one of the standard formats:

       Fixed: A fixed number of decimal places  (set  in  the  precision  spin
              box).  The actual format used is "(F0._n)".  WARNING: this may be
              a GNU extension.

       Sci:   Scientific format. Specify the number of decimals, and the width
              of the exponent in the spin boxes. The total width is calculated
              automatically.

       Eng:   Engineering format, similar to scientific, except that the expo‐
              nent is always a multiple of 3.

       Free:  Use a list-directed write (the default).

       Alternatively  you  can  type an explicit Fortran format statement into
       the combo box (with or without the enclosing parentheses). This may  be
       any Fortran formatting code valid for a REAL type. Setting it to "*" or
       an empty string will use the default list-directed output (as  will  an
       invalid format).

       This  menu  also  includes  an  option  to show or suppress the leading
       zeroes in base-_n displays.

   SShhooww ddeeggrreeeess::
       If this is enabled, then use angular rather than time notation for  the
       HMS display (the button will be relabelled DDMMSS).

   CCUUTT && PPAASSTTEE::
       The EEddiitt menu has options to cut or copy the selected text in the entry
       window (or the result window in the case of copy) to the clipboard. The
       current  clipboard  item  my  also be pasted into the entry box, or the
       selected text may be deleted. The usual keybindings  for  these  opera‐
       tions are also available.

   HHEELLPP SSYYSSTTEEMM::
       This manual can be accessed in a number of ways:

       1.     A manpage is generated and can be accessed using man rpncalc.

       2.     The  ``Help'' item in the menu will display either the text ver‐
              sion or (if the environment variable RPNCALC_VIEWER is set to  a
              PDF viewer) the PDF version.

       3.     The  text  and PDF versions are installed in the share/docs/rpn‐
              calc subdirectory of the installation directory.

   AACCCCEELLEERRAATTOORRSS::
       The menu items have accerators to save mouse clicking:

       **      Save -- ctrl-s

       **      Restore -- ctrl-o

       **      Quit -- ctrl-q
