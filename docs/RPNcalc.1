.SS INTRODUCTION
.PP
The gtk\-fortran RPN calculator is a fully functional scientific 
calculator emulator. It is not based on any particular model of 
calculator, but rather assembles those features that I find useful in 
a calculator. It uses the stack\-based reverse Polish logic system for 
2 reasons: 
.TP
1.
That\&'s what I like to use, and most calculator emulators are 
algebraic notation. 
.TP
2.
I\&'m lazy and it\&'s a lot easier to implement a reverse Polish 
system. 
.PP
It is intended to be both a useful tool, and a demonstration of what 
can be done using gtk\-fortran (and in particular the fortran\-only 
high\-level routines). The calculator is entirely written in 
Fortran 2003 (with a few 2008 features such as the 
execute_command_line
subroutine. 
.PP
.SS ENTERING VALUES:
.PP
All values with RPNcalc are stored as double\-precision reals (Gtk+ 
has no support for long doubles). 
.PP
Values can be entered either using the keypad, or by typing into the 
entry box. Values entered from the keypad make sanity checks for 2 
decimal points or a decimal entered after the exponent has been 
started and the change\-sign key works in a reasonably intelligent 
way. When values are typed or pasted into the entry box, characters 
that cannot be part of a number are rejected with a warning. 
.PP
A value may be transferred from the entry to the stack by pressing 
the keyboard Enter
key while focus is on the entry window, 
or by clicking the \fBEnter\fP
key on the keypad. The \fBDup\fP
key copies the entry box to the stack without clearing the entry 
box. If the contents of the entry box are not a valid number (i.e. a 
Fortran READ
statement cannot convert it to a floating point 
value) a message is displayed in the status bar and you may edit the 
entry box to correct the problem. 
.PP
.SS OPERATORS:
.PP
The operators (\fB+\fP,
\fB\-\fP,
\fB*\fP,
\fB/\fP
and 
\fBy**x\fP
and also the \fBatan2\fP
function) operate on the entry 
box and the top element on the stack if there is anything in the 
entry box. If the entry box is empty, then they operate on the top 2 
elements of the stack. 
.PP
Operators may also be accessed by typing the operator into the entry 
window (N.B. The exponentiation operator is ^
rather than 
**
for convenience of implementation). The addition and 
subtraction operators will only work in this way if a sign would not 
be a valid part of a number where they are entered, notably 
+
or \-
in an empty entry box is not treated as an 
operator. Note also that operators at the end of a multi\-character 
paste are not accepted. 
.PP
The result is placed on the top of the stack, and displayed in the 
result window. 
.PP
.SS FUNCTIONS:
.PP
The functions operate on a single value, which is taken from the 
entry box if that has content or from the top of the stack 
otherwise. The result is placed on the top of the stack, and 
displayed in the result window. 
.PP
If the \fBInverse\fP
checkbox is set, then functions are replaced 
by their inverses (e.g. \fBsin\fP
becomes \fBasin\fP),
in 
addition, the \fBy**x\fP
operator becomes the 
corresponding root and the 
\fIroll down\fP
button becomes \fIroll up\fP\&.
Note that: 
.TP
1.
The less\-used functions in the pulldown are not affected by 
this, as none have meaningful inverses. 
.TP
2.
The power operator \fB^\fP entered from the keyboard is not
converted to a root. 
.PP
The \fBRad\fP,
\fBDeg\fP
and \fBGrad\fP
radio buttons are 
used to select Radians, Degrees or Grads for the trigonometric 
functions. 
.PP
The \fBHMS\fP
and the various base\-\fIn\fP
keys are not proper 
functions, they don\&'t remove or add anything to the stack. 
\fBHMS\fPdisplays
the contents of the entry box or the top of the 
stack as if it were a number of hours converted to 
\fIHH\fP\fB:\fP\fIMM\fP\fB:\fP\fISS.sss\fP
format (or 
\fID\fP\fBd\fP \fIHH\fP\fBh\fP \fIMM\fP\fBm\fP \fISS.sss\fP\fBs\fP
if the value is greater than 24). The \fBHexadecimal\fP,
Octal
and \fBBinary\fP
keys will display the integer 
representation of entry value or the top of the stack in the 
respective notations provided that the value is an integer. 
.PP
Some less\-used functions are in the \fBMore\fP
pulldown. The 
\fBatan2\fP
function computes arctan(y/x)
removing the 
quadrant ambiguities. 
.PP
Functions whose arguments are out of range will produce an error 
message and the stack is left unchanged. 
.PP
.SS STACK OPERATIONS
.PP
.TP
.B *
\fBCE\fP clears the entry box, or if that is empty deletes
the top entry on the stack. 
.PP
.TP
.B *
\fBCA\fP clears the entry box and all entries on the stack.
.PP
.TP
.B *
The \fIup\fP button moves the selected item in the stack up
one place. If the top item (or nothing) is selected then it is 
exchanged with the entry box. 
.PP
.TP
.B *
The \fIdown\fP button moves the selected entry on the stack
down one place. 
.PP
.TP
.B *
The \fIroll down\fP button, moves the last element of the
stack to the top and all others down one place. 
.PP
.SS CONSTANTS:
.PP
There are a number of built in fundamental physics constants that are 
build in to the calculator, these can be entered from the 
\fBPhys\fP
pull\-down menu. 
.PP
.SS MEMORY REGISTERS:
.PP
The calculator also has memory registers (numbered from 0). The 
contents of these registers can be viewed by selecting the 
``registers\&'' tab. The default number of registers is 10, but this 
may be set with the \fB\-m\fP
option, or by setting a new number in 
the spin box at the bottom of the registers tab. 
.PP
These can be accessed in one of two ways: 
.TP
1.
Select a register in the registers tab, and then click a memory 
operation. In this case the value used will be the entry box or the 
top of the stack if the entry is empty. 
.TP
2.
Enter a register number in the entry box and click the memory 
operation. The value used is the top of the stack. 
.PP
The operations are: 
.TP
.B *
\fBSTO:\fP Store the value in the selected register.
.TP
.B *
\fBRCL:\fP Copy the selected register to the top of the
stack 
.TP
.B *
\fBM+:\fP Add the value to the selected register
.TP
.B *
\fBM\-:\fP Subtract the value from the selected register
.TP
.B *
\fBMCL:\fP Clear the selected register.
.TP
.B *
\fBMCA:\fP Clear all registers
.PP
.SS STATISTICS:
.PP
If the \fBLive stats\fP
toggle is enabled, then a summary of the 
statistical properties of the contents of the stack is maintained in 
the "Statistics" tab of the display area. 
.PP
.SS SAVE & RESTORE:
.PP
The stack, registers and entry box can be saved to and restored from 
a text file with the \fBFile\->Save\fP
and 
\fBFile\->Restore\fP
menu items. 
.PP
The file format is a plain text file with the floating point values 
written in hexadecimal \-\- this allows the retention of full\-precision 
but is endian\-independent. Obviously any machines that do not use 
IEEE floating point values will not be able to read files from other 
machines. Also any machine with a c_double
that is not 
8\-bytes will not work. 
.PP
.SS SETTINGS:
.PP
In the current version, there are 2 user\-definable settings accessed 
through the \fBEdit\fP
menu: 
.PP
.SS Result Format:
Specify the format to use in the result box. You have the options to 
select one of the standard formats: 
.TP
Fixed: 
A fixed number of decimal places (set in the precision 
spin box). The actual format used is "(F0.\fIn\fP)".
WARNING: this 
may be a GNU extension. 
.TP
Sci: 
Scientific format. Specify the number of decimals, and 
the width of the exponent in the spin boxes. The total width is 
calculated automatically. 
.TP
Eng: 
Engineering format, similar to scientific, except that 
the exponent is always a multiple of 3. 
.TP
Free: 
Use a list\-directed write (the default). 
.PP
Alternatively you can type an explicit Fortran format statement into 
the combo box (with or without the enclosing parentheses). This may 
be any Fortran formatting code valid for a REAL type. Setting it to 
"*" or an empty string will use the default list\-directed output (as 
will an invalid format). 
.PP
This menu also includes an option to show or suppress the leading 
zeroes in base\-\fIn\fP
displays. 
.PP
.SS Show degrees:
If this is enabled, then use angular rather than time notation for the 
HMS display (the button will be relabelled \fBDMS\fP).
.PP
.SS CUT & PASTE:
.PP
The \fBEdit\fP
menu has options to cut or copy the selected text in 
the entry window (or the result window in the case of copy) to the 
clipboard. The current clipboard item my also be pasted into the entry 
box, or the selected text may be deleted. The usual keybindings for 
these operations are also available. 
.PP
.SS HELP SYSTEM:
.PP
This manual can be accessed in a number of ways: 
.TP
1.
A manpage is generated and can be accessed using 
man rpncalc\&.
.TP
2.
The ``Help\&'' item in the menu will display either the text 
version or (if the environment variable RPNCALC_VIEWER
is 
set to a PDF viewer) the PDF version. 
.TP
3.
The text and PDF versions are installed in the 
share/docs/rpncalc
subdirectory of the installation directory.
